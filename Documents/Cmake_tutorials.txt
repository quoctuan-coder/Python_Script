    1. Introduction
        - Cmake is a tool to manage building of source code.
        - Cmake is widely used for the C and C++ languages.
        - Cmake is a tool to generate Makefiles.

    2. Synopsis (Tom tat)
        - Generate a Project buildsystem
        - Build a project
        - install a project
        - open a project
        - Run a script
        - Run a command line
        - Run the Find-Package tool
        - View help

    3. CMake buildsystem
    - Source Tree   <-  CMakeLists.txt
    - Build Tree    ->  CMakeCache.txt (which must have already been generated by a previous 
    run of CMake)
    - Generator     <- View help

    4. Generate a Project buildsystem
        The source tree must contain a CMakeLists.txt (which is generated by user)

    cmkae -S src -B build 
        <path to src> <path to build>: The specified paths may be absolute or relative.


    5. CMakeLists structure.
        cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.9)
        project (hello)
        add_executable(hello helloworld.cpp)

    6. Build system multiples directory
    
    7. Build system shared library

    8. Build system static library
        - Được tạo tai thời điểm compile để tổng hợp toàn bộ code
